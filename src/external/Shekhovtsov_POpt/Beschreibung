Hi Paul,

So lets start with this. I'v put the code in the archive, maybe I
should take it to github later on.

Find
./projects/part_opt/CmakeLists.txt
run cmake (gui)
configure the directories that show up there and geenrate.
Here, a great improvement would be if opengm and hdf5 were found
automatically, but I do not know how to do it.

Compile, you get
./bin/test_random (try this first)
./bin/test_part_opt_opengm

If everything works as expected, look inside
./code/optim/part_opt/test_part_opt_opengm.cpp

you will find how to invoke my solver with opengm interface:
#include "part_opt_opengm.h"
// create your model
part_opt_opengm<DATA, opengm::Adder> alg(data);
alg.infer();
// take the filled DATA

Plug it into your evaluation. The only header to include is
code/optim/part_opt/part_opt_opengm.h.
It itself includes only opengm headers and not any mine.
Link with exttype.lib and part_opt.lib or whatever is get created in
./lib
directory.

I do not know where Kolmogorov's maxflow is compiled in opengm. If we
get to this, I will update to exclude it from part_opt.lib.

Let me know if there are any problems. I tested test_random on mac but
not test_part_opt_opengm yet. I'll check it today.

Cheers!
Sasha
